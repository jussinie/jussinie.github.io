title: Habit update from week 7
---

It seems that writing these weekly updates is really difficult. I believe it comes down to the fact that my habits in this area are lacking. 
If I think about my morning routines, I do them constantly, each and every morning. 

:fire: 3x Gym <br>
:fire: 2x Singing <br>
:fire: Morning routines every day <br>
:fire: Started writing about product management <br>

One big problem is that I don't have a proper execution plan for the things I want to do. I should have more strict routine and track where my time actually goes. Now it feels that I have a lot of time on my hands but eventually not that much of a result to show. Or then my attention is split between too many areas and I am not able to really focus on any of them... I started working on my old timekeeping app so that I'd have a nice way of tracking where I spend my time. 

Today's singing was really nice - tried few new songs from Harry Styles. Also tried padel for the first time today. It was nice, quite similar to tennis but quite different at the same time. Will see if this becomes something that I'd do more often. At work therer are very interesting things going on, lot of ideas flying around, discovery happening and new products forming. Very excited to start a new week tomorrow!
