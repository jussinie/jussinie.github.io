title: Summary from year 2022 and what happens in 2023
---

Hi, and happy new year! It is the first of January and time to have a look on how year 2022 went. I had big ambitions when last year started.I was about to read (at least) 12 books, write about all of them as well as do multiple university courses while getting better in my day job as product manager. After failing in achieving my non-work related goals I realize that I did not understand what it takes to succeed. I did not know how to take the guidance from James Clear and apply it into practice.

James Clear writes in Atomic Habits that one must start small. This is the basic idea in forming new habits. Do something for one minute. When you can do that, do it for two minutes. As I like to think big and overestimate what can be achieved in short amount of time I thought (again) that I can do much more immediately. Well, that did not go well. I wrote only three blog posts last year but read lot of books, though, even though I was able to write only from one of them. As I have learned more about product management I have realized that the right way to do things is to get something small done, get feedback and iterate from there. For a Finn this is difficult, as everything should be perfect before it can be shown to anyone. I have learned my lesson. 

So I am starting this year a bit wiser. I will start small and conquer my goals. Let's forget that going to the moon (and back) attitude and focus on the small things - that next workout, next day at work, next meal, next line of code. Those little steps will accumulate and before you know it, you have achieved something tangible. 

For year 2023 I have goals when it comes to sport, health, reading, writing and learning. However, I am not going to tell you about them now. Those are the topics for the next posts.

Have a good week everyone.
