title: Habit update from week 1
---

Hello, you! I've been now tracking my eating for the past two weeks and that gives me quite a nice understanding on how much I should eat compared to what I burn. As I mentioned last week, in the office it is difficult to estimate what the food you put in your mouth contains. However, for next week I want to raise the bets and start to note the amount of protein I get from my food. I have quite regular snacks and breakfast so that should be quite easy. One way to make things easier (from the calculation perspective) and cheaper would be to take lunch with me to work. Don't know if I am ready for that yet but it is also an option. 

Yesterday I prepared a big chunk of food already - 1,5kg of potato wedges and huge pan of minced meat / soy. I wanted to try mixing these two and the result was quite nice. 400g of minced meat and 150g of soy gave me a huge pan full of delicious raw material to be used like minced meat when cooking. I seasoned it with some taco spices and it tastes very good. Of course the goal is to ditch that minced meat altogether but I think this is a nice start. I have done also some chili sin carne from soy only but wanted to try this mix now. For today there is still some food prepping to be done, so that also the greens are in a form that can be easily consumed during the week. 

If we then look at the goals for week 2, they were: 

- 3x Gym
- 1x Jog
- 2x Studying
- Evening routines in place
  - Mobility exercise
  - Getting to bed before 10 PM

And the results? 

**Summary for week 2:**

:fire: 4x Gym
:fire: 1x Jog 
:fire: Morning routines every day
:fire: Meal tracking every day
:fire: Studying more than twice
:fire: Singing started for this year

:hankey: Evening routines

So basically doing sport still had strong tailwind

Week ago I returned to Helsinki and got back to normal my routines. Those consist from my morning ritual (Duolingo, yoga, journal, reading some german) and getting to the gym at least thrice a week. On the mornings I am not toiling at the gym, I'll study. Morning routines went well, this week was another success on that front. 

I started tracking my eating, basically just that I eat regularly at least five meals a day. Tracking wasn't that hard to do, as I wasn't snacking anything in between meals. I also did not surrender to any treats at home or at work. It is much easier when you keep your blood sugar levels in check by eating healthily (and enough) throughout the day. In addition, I started to track calories I eat. Most difficult part of it is if I eat somewhere else than home as then I just have to somehow approximate how much energy that food contains. When I am able to track on this level for some weeks, maybe I'll then start adding some information about the macronutrients I get. Today I noticed that I should stick to my regular meals that are easy to make and easy to track. That saves me from lot of troubles. The more this thing is automated and built as a habit, the easier it is.

I have seen results both at the gym and on the scale. My training weights have increased when my bodyweight has come down (-1,2kg). The calorie intake has been in balance as Garmin tells me a number for burned calories and I try to match that with my eating. Saturday's gym session was wild - I don't know if the reason was new supplements I got or pizza I ate the day before but man I was lit! In every movement I was able to make more reps with more weights. On the other hand, I was not that successful in my studies this week. I think I logged some minutes for it but it is far from the amount of time that would need to be invested to get some courses done. Luckily today (Sunday) I was able to use over an hour to improve my skills with Docker.
