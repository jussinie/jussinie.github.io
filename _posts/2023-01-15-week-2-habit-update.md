title: Habit update from week 2
---

Hello, you! I've been now tracking my eating for the past two weeks and that gives me quite a nice understanding on how much I should eat compared to what I burn. As I mentioned last week, in the office it is difficult to estimate what the food you put in your mouth contains. However, for next week I want to raise the bets and start track the amount of protein I get from my food. The snacks and breakfast I eat are quite similar from day to day so that should be quite easy. One way to make things easier (from the calculation perspective) and cheaper would be to take lunch with me to work. Don't know if I am ready for that yet but it is also an option. 

Yesterday I prepared a big chunk of food - 1,5kg of potato wedges and huge pan of minced meat / soy. I wanted to try mixing these two and the result was quite nice. 400g of minced meat and 150g of soy gave me a huge pan full of delicious raw material to be used like minced meat when cooking. I seasoned it with some taco spices and got the taste very good. Of course the goal is to ditch that minced meat altogether but I think this is a nice start. I have done also some chili sin carne from soy only but wanted to try this mix now. For today there is still some food prepping to be done, so that also the greens are in a form that can be easily consumed during the week. 

If we then look at the goals for week 2, they were: 

- 3x Gym
- 1x Jog
- 2x Studying
- Evening routines in place
  - Mobility exercise
  - Getting to bed before 10 PM

And the results? 

**Summary for week 2:**

:fire: 4x Gym
:fire: 1x Evening walk
:fire: Morning routines every day
:fire: Meal tracking every day
:fire: Studying more than twice
:fire: Singing started for this year

:hankey: Evening routines

So basically doing sport still had strong tailwind this week whereas evening routines were a struggle. Having an alarm set at 21.30 did not do the trick, even though I did do mobility exercise almost every evening. Studying went better this week but it needs better scheduling for sure.
