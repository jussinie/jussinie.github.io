title: Habit update from week 1
---

Week ago I returned to Helsinki and got back to normal my routines. Those consist from my morning ritual (Duolingo, yoga, journal, reading some german) and getting to the gym at least thrice a week. On the mornings I am not toiling at the gym, I'll study. Morning routines went well, this week was another success on that front. 

I started tracking my eating, basically just that I eat regularly at least five meals a day. Tracking wasn't that hard to do, as I wasn't snacking anything in between meals. I also did not surrender to any treats at home or at work. It is much easier when you keep your blood sugar levels in check by eating healthily (and enough) throughout the day. In addition, I started to track calories I eat. Most difficult part of it is if I eat somewhere else than home as then I just have to somehow approximate how much energy that food contains. When I am able to track on this level for some weeks, maybe I'll then start adding some information about the macronutrients I get. Today I noticed that I should stick to my regular meals that are easy to make and easy to track. That saves me from lot of troubles. The more this thing is automated and built as a habit, the easier it is.

I have seen results both at the gym and on the scale. My training weights have increased when my bodyweight has come down (-1,2kg). The calorie intake has been in balance as Garmin tells me a number for burned calories and I try to match that with my eating. Saturday's gym session was wild - I don't know if the reason was new supplements I got or pizza I ate the day before but man I was lit! In every movement I was able to make more reps with more weights. On the other hand, I was not that successful in my studies this week. I think I logged some minutes for it but it is far from the amount of time that would need to be invested to get some courses done. Luckily today (Sunday) I was able to use over an hour to improve my skills with Docker.
