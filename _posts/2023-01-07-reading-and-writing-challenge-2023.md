title: My reading and writing challenge 2023
---

As I've written elsewhere on these pages, I really like to buy and read books. However, it is not always easy when you have grand ambitions. Have a look [here]({% link 2022-01-08-books-for-2022.md}) if you want to see how I failed miserably in my last challenge I put for myself. Instead of 12 books there is only three in the list and even less writing about these books. 

I still want to write about what I have learned but I need better habits in doing that. I'll now start with 15 minutes a day - 10 minutes of reading and 5 minutes of writing what I learned. We'll see where we get with that.
