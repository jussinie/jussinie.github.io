title: Habit update from week 3
---

I have been unsuccessful, failing to give an update last week. My week 2 for this year looked like this:

:fire: 4x Gym
:fire: 1x Evening walk
:fire: Morning routines every day
:fire: Meal tracking every day
:fire: Studying more than twice
:fire: Singing started for this year

I did improve this week as I went to the gym 5 times. Otherwise it was just like week two. 
Some walking, habit tracking, relaxing and some singing on Sunday as well.

One thing that does not yet work is getting to be before 10 PM. I have done mobility exercise every evening, though!

Next week there is lot of things on the calendar already, colleagues from abroad at work and so on.
