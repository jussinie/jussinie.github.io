Hi, stranger! My page awaits you. My name is Jussi. I am interested in new technologies, coding and I want to constantly learn something new. Particularly fascinating is to try to understand how human mind (and body) works. On this site I want to ponder upon these topics. My method is to read about things and then write about what I have learned. If you want to see more on this, check my [12 books challence]({% post_url 2022-01-08-books-for-2022 %}) for 2022. 

I do work full time but on the side I have a hobby of doing computer science studies at the university. That's why some of my goals for 2022 include programming and not only reading fascinating books. But I really do want to emphasize that I find coding fascinating as well.
