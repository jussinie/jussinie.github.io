Hi, stranger! My page awaits you. My name is Jussi. I am interested in new technologies, product management, programming, and I want to constantly learn something new. Particularly fascinating is to try to understand how human mind (and body) works. On this site I want to ponder upon these topics. I learn by reading and then writing about what I have learned. If you want to see more of this, check my [12 books challenge]({% link books_2022.md %}) for 2022. 

I do work full time but on the side I have a hobby of doing computer science studies at the university of Helsinki. Coding is something that I find really fascinating. It is one of my favorite pastimes, believe it or not. If you want to see more what I have tinkered, please have a look at my github. The best feeling I get when learning new things is when these things start to make connections. First everything is only random dots but in time the connections between them start to emerge. When dots in different fields of science start to connect - it gets really interesting! Human brain is a muscle and needs to be trained. I can't think of any better way of excercise than that. 

I hope you find the content on these pages interesting and worth reading. If not, luckily there are lot of other pages in the internet to scroll through. As our time on this planet is limited, there is no reason to use it with uninteresting or uninspiring things.
