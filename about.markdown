Hi, stranger! My page awaits you. My name is Jussi. I am interested in new technologies, programming and I want to constantly learn something new. Particularly fascinating is to try to understand how human mind (and body) works. On this site I want to ponder upon these topics. I learn by reading about things and then writing about what I have learned. If you want to see more on this, check my [12 books challenge]({% link books_2022.md %}) for 2022. 

I do work full time but on the side I have a hobby of doing computer science studies at the university. That's why some of my goals for 2022 include programming and not only reading fascinating books. But I really do want to emphasize that I find coding fascinating as well. It is one of my favorite pastimes, believe it or not. If you want to see more what I have tinkered, please have a look at my github. 

I hope you find the content on these pages interesting and worth reading. If not, luckily there are lot of other pages in the internet to scroll through. At least I have had the opportunity to delve into all these fascinating worlds when writing you about them.
